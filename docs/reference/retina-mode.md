For any Enterprise+ member the retina function is available.

The maximum graphic size for all graphics, except maps, is 998,001 pixels in total and the maximum width or length is 999 pixels, now thanks to Retina you can double the size.

#### Syntax


```
icretina=<bit>
```

- **`<bit>`** 0 for false and 1 for true.

#### Example

Here is a graph of 700 pixels x 200 pixels without retina
